= DumpRake

Tasks to create and restore dumps of database and assets.

== Install

  script/plugin install git://github.com/toy/dump.git

Put paths of dirs you want to dump in file <tt>config/assets</tt>.

Example

  public/audios
  public/flash
  public/images/upload
  public/videos

When using cap tasks — be sure to link dump folder to persistent place on deploy, or you will lose all dumps every deploy.

This plugin requires gems (but to reduce problems on shared hostings, unpacked versions of archive-tar-minitar-0.5.2 and progress-1.0.1 are used if they are not present):

  archive/tar/minitar
  progress (version 1.0.0 or later)

To install:

  gem install archive-tar-minitar progress

== Capistrano integration

You can use cap dump:* tasks to control dumps on remote server. Don't forget to deploy application to remote server before using dump:remote tasks.
Also you can set custom remote rake binary in your deploy.rb like:

  set :rake, "/custom/rake"

== Usage

  # create dump
  rake dump
  rake dump:create

  # list avaliable dumps
  rake dump:versions

  # restore dump
  rake dump:restore

  # delete old and unfinished dumps (all non tgz files will be deleted if they are not locked)
  rake dump:cleanup

=== Environment variables

==== While creating dumps:

<tt>DESC</tt>, <tt>DESCRIPTION</tt> — free form description of dump

  rake dump DESC='uploaded photos'

<tt>TAG</tt>, <tt>TAGS</tt> — comma separated list of tags

  rake dump TAGS='photos,videos'

<tt>ASSETS</tt> — comma or colon separated list of paths or globs to dump

  rake dump ASSETS='public/system:public/images/masks/*'
  rake dump ASSETS='public/system,public/images/masks/*'

<tt>TABLES</tt> — comma separated list of tables to dump or if prefixed by "-" — to skip; by default only sessions table is skipped; schema_info and schema_migrations are always included if they are present

dump all tables except sessions:
  rake dump

dump all tables:
  rake dump TABLES='-'

dump only people, pages and photos tables:
  rake dump TABLES='people,pages,photos'

dump all tables except people and pages:
  rake dump TABLES='-people,pages'

==== While restoring dumps:

<tt>LIKE</tt>, <tt>VER</tt>, <tt>VERSION</tt> — filter dumps by full dump name

  rake dump:versions LIKE='2009'
  rake dump:restore LIKE='2009' # restores last dump matching 2009

<tt>TAG</tt>, <tt>TAGS</tt> — comma separated list of tags
without '+' or '-' — dump should have any of such tags
prefixed with '+' — dump should have every tag with prefix
prefixed with '-' — dump should not have any of tags with prefix

select dumps with tags photos or videos:
  rake dump:restore TAGS='photos,videos'

select dumps with tags photos and videos:
  rake dump:restore TAGS='+photos,+videos'

skip dumps with tags mirror and archive:
  rake dump:restore TAGS='-mirror,-archive'

select dumps with tags photos or videos, with tag important and without mirror:
  rake dump:restore TAGS='photos,videos,+important,-mirror'

<tt>MIGRATE_DOWN</tt> — don't run down for migrations not present in dump if you pass "0", "no" or "false"; pass "reset" to recreate (drop and create) db
by default all migrations which are not present in dump are ran down

don't run down for migrations:
  rake dump:restore MIGRATE_DOWN=no

reset database:
  rake dump:restore MIGRATE_DOWN=reset

<tt>RESTORE_SCHEMA</tt> — don't read/change schema if you pass "0", "no" or "false" (useful to just restore data for table; note that schema info tables are also not restored)

don't restore schema:
  rake dump:restore RESTORE_SCHEMA=no

<tt>RESTORE_TABLES</tt> — works as TABLES, but for restoring

restores only people, pages and photos tables:
  rake dump RESTORE_TABLES='people,pages,photos'

restores all tables except people and pages:
  rake dump TABLES='-people,pages'

<tt>RESTORE_ASSETS</tt> — works as ASSETS, but for restoring

  rake dump RESTORE_ASSETS='public/system/a,public/system/b'
  rake dump RESTORE_ASSETS='public/system/a:public/images/masks/*/new*'

==== For listing dumps:

<tt>LIKE</tt>, <tt>VER</tt>, <tt>VERSION</tt> and <tt>TAG</tt>, <tt>TAGS</tt> as for restoring

<tt>SUMMARY</tt> — output info about dump: "1", "true" or "yes" for basic info, "2" or "schema" to display schema as well

  rake dump:versions SUMMARY=1
  rake dump:versions SUMMARY=full # output schema too

==== For cleanup:

<tt>LIKE</tt>, <tt>VER</tt>, <tt>VERSION</tt> and <tt>TAG</tt>, <tt>TAGS</tt> as for restoring

<tt>LEAVE</tt> — number of dumps to leave

  rake dump:cleanup LEAVE=10
  rake dump:cleanup LEAVE=none

=== cap tasks

For all cap commands environment variables are same as for rake tasks

<tt>TRANSFER_VIA</tt> — transfer method (rsync, sftp or scp)
By default transferring task will try to transfer using rsync if it is present, else it will try to use sftp and scp

force transfer using scp:
  cap dump:remote:download TRANSFER_VIA=scp
  cap dump:mirror:down TRANSFER_VIA=scp

<tt>BACKUP</tt>, <tt>AUTOBACKUP</tt>, <tt>AUTO_BACKUP</tt> — no autobackup if you pass "0", "no" or "false"
by default backup is created before mirroring

don't create backup:
  cap dump:mirror:down BACKUP=0
  cap dump:mirror:down AUTOBACKUP=no
  cap dump:mirror:down AUTO_BACKUP=false

==== Basic cap tasks are same as rake tasks

  cap dump:local
  cap dump:local:create
  cap dump:local:restore
  cap dump:local:versions
  cap dump:local:cleanup

  cap dump:remote
  cap dump:remote:create
  cap dump:remote:restore
  cap dump:remote:versions
  cap dump:remote:cleanup

==== Dump exchanging tasks
